To determine the best matches, we want to show host families only students they can accommodate.
This means students with no pet preference, religious preference, or students with certain restrictions on their ideal
family will not be displayed to families that are not an initial good match.

From that initial list of possible students the families can host, we also want to show a legend indicator (percentage maybe?) of how well of a match that is.
This could mean the family and the student share some common characteristic; such as religion, hobbies,  and general proximity (very close by).

Using this indicator, we will display students with most match at the top, going down to very little match at the bottom.
Although this is very systematic, families can seek out students that vary background significantly or seek out students with very similar backgrounds.

Because we want students to be receptive of the families that may seek them out, we will give the student the opportunity to select a possible host family that has selected them.


Additional Features/Future Considerations
    - The ability for the student to select if they want a family that is similar to their background or different --- thus optimizing the system to show families that differ from the students background
    - Ability for the Hosting Program (through the university or company) to organize a meetup of the families and their matches
    - Ability for families to log their interactions with their students
    - Ability for students to provide feedback about their host family and satisfaction levels
    - Ability for University or Host Family Company to monitor this information; therefore intervening if a match is not going well or family/student is not receptive of arrangement
    - Anything else
